1. Draw the web request response cycle for the task at hand (about 15 minutes).
Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
2. Do a formal code review of each person’s code (15 minutes each).
Open your partner’s GitHub Pull Request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don’t understand
or seams overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting
3. Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.
You will then work independently for the rest of the day, implementing your plan, coding in your own repository, submitting your own pull request.

You will have access to view the code base for the client, but will not be able to modify it in any way.

For this lab assignment, you will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 through 9, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.
